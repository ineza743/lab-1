    <h1>PROJECTS</h1>
    <h2>Database project</h2>
    <p>
        • Design an efficient database for Ashesi University that can allow the database administrator (Ashesi
employee) to store every capstone project done by Ashesi students and allows
students to retrieve this information easily at any time.<br>
•    This database keeps track of capstone projects that have already been done and the group of people who implemented these projects.
The end-users or those retrieving the information should be able to tell the supervisor of the
project or if the project received external support. 

•   For easy access and retrieval, these capstone
projects were categorized according to the academic department in which the
students implementing it are found.
    </p>
